## Description
The Drosophila Individual Activity Monitoring Detection System (DIAMonDS) is a software with the capability to monitor fly activity and recognize certain milestones in the life cycle of a fly. This software was pioneered and discussed in a paper by Seong et al. (2020). An Epson Perfection V600 Scanner is used in collaboration with VueScan software to collect time lapse images to input into the DIAMonDS system. Additionally, independent timelapse video may be created from the scannerâ€™s images using Fiji. These videos allow for manual detection of fly activity across a known period of time, with particular significance in comparing fly populations.

## Dependencies
A complete list of dependencies can be found in the environment.yml file. Use of Diamonds/Sapphire program does require Anaconda. 

## Installation Instructions
### Creating Conda Environment
1. Download this repository to local files. 
2. In terminal window, change directory to downloaded folder. Create and activate sapphire environment
```console
